# BACASABLE

BACASABLE is a free BAC (Badlion AntiCheat) HWID (hardware identifier) spoofer that I decided to release for free to get BAC developers to update the AntiCheat so all users of this spoofer (HEDA, 6ix, Stretch... all owned by niggeo / Xlax / 6ix -> all those are his aliases and he has been scamming the entire CWBW German community for years now) will get banned.

This spoofer is really simple: it removes regedit entries for display monitors and then maps a driver using [kdmapper](https://github.com/z175/kdmapper) to spoof disk identifiers.

Use at your own risk ; if you get an "Access Denied" error, remove the regedit entries manually (check the code to find their respective paths).
